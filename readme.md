# Bone Shakers!

![Demo](Images/demo.gif)

Bone Shakers is a racing game where skeletons ride unicycles around a dungeon race track. It was designed for the [Arduboy miniature game system](https://www.arduboy.com) as part of the [Unofficial Arduboy game jam of September 2018](https://community.arduboy.com/t/unofficial-game-jam-4-1st-sept-to-the-10th-sep-2018/6254/104). In part inspired by Super Mario Kart for the SNES
